# svicknair-com

This is the underlying code that is used to build and deploy the main content for [https://stacyvicknair.com](https://stacyvicknair.com). In many ways this is a learning experiment but I also hope that it serves as a great platform that helps me accomplish what I hope to accomplish with my personal website.

## Built With

This website is built with a few technologies. Those in bold I'm using for the first time.

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A javascript library for building user interfaces
* **[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)** - A React-based framework for static websites
* **[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)** - Gatsby uses GraphQL
* **[Material UI](https://material-ui.com)** - A React component library based on material design, bridged into GatsbyJS via [gatsby-plugin-material-ui](https://github.com/hupe1980/gatsby-plugin-material-ui)
* **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)** - A feature of GitHub that allows for custom domain hosting of personal or project websites directly from a repo
